## Introduction

This guide contains instructions for installing a Kubernetes cluster version 1.30 using [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm) and Helm. 
We will install [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io) as CRI (Container Runtime Interface) and [Flannel](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel) as CNI (Container Network Interface). I chose CRI-O for several reasons:
* CRI-O is more secure than a container due to its limited set of features and internal components, which reduces the attack surface
* CRI-O has a clear component structure that is published
* CRI-O has many users and an active community

By installing the components step by step, you will assemble the cluster as a constructor. You will learn how to manage the Hetzner balancer using the annotations specified in the values ​​file for the Ingress Controller. All cluster nodes will be located within a single Hetzner network. Requests from the Internet to the cluster will be made through the Hetzner load balancer. This configuration allows you to close cluster nodes from external connections with a firewall. It makes your cluster more secure.

**Prerequisites**

* 3 virtual machines in the Hetzner Cloud (1 for master, 2 for workers) with the Ubuntu 24.04 operating system and connected to the same Hetzner Network
* Hetzner Cloud [API token](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token) in the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud)
* [TLS certificate](https://docs.hetzner.com/konsoleh/ssl/certificates/#how-to-import-an-existing-certificate) imported into the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud)

**Example terminology**

* Username: `holu` (short for Hetzner OnLine User)
* Hostname: `<your_host>`
* Domain: `<example.com>`
* Subdomain: `<sub.example.com>`
* IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6):
   * Server: `<10.0.0.1>`
   * Gateway `<192.0.2.254>`
   * Client private: `<198.51.100.1>`
   * Client public: `<203.0.113.1>`

## Step 1 - Configure repositories


In this step we will add the Kubernetes and CRI-O repositories on all cluster nodes

Setting the Kubernetes version as an environment variable

```bash
KUBERNETES_VERSION=v1.30
```

## Step 2 - Summary of Step

Quick introduction.

Start by...

Then...

Finally...

### Step 2.1 - Summary of Step

You can create code examples in nearly every programming language.
Just state the language after the first three backticks in your Markdown file.

Here is a code example

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

### Step 2.2 - Summary of Step

Another code example

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

## Step 3 - Summary of Step (Optional)

Instructions for a step that is not necessary to complete the tutorial, but can be helpful.

## Step N - Summary of Step

Yet more instructions.

## Conclusion

A short conclusion summarizing what the user has done, and maybe suggesting different courses of action they can now take.
